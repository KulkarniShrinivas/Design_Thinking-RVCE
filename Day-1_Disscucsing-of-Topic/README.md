 action to combat climate change and its imapcts 


If we take this question how we need to ask to other peoples or how we can collect the data 
according to pritive survey is not possible to this so better to think other topics 

About climate change what are the issues people are facing we can make interaction by making survey and asking Farmers what has been effect to there crops 

In bussiness also climate change makes big effect As pritwi father has wood bussiness and sometime rai effect the whole bussines due to climate change hevy rain occurs in diffrecnt month not exactly in specifc month 



How we  can solve the problem what changes we can make to resolve is the main issue?

second topic what I suggested is Ensure acess affordable sustainable and modern energy for all 

In this we can make surveys on Households and bussiness and energy providers policymakers 

How we can resolve this?


On the topic what we disscussed is Redusing Plastic Waste 

Why this topic?

How can we reduce plastic waste and promote sustainable alternatives?
Areas to explore might include biodegradable materials, recycling programs, and consumer behavior changes.
