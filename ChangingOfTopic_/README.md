We decided not to explore the topic of Local Bussiness support and instead Sports as a Tool for  Mental and Physical Health for several reasons:

- Audience Relevance:

The chosen topic will be more real and directly relevant to the audience we are engaging with, which likely includes parents and other stakeholders in youth development. This topic speaks to everyday concerns and experiences that many participants can relate to, making it more influential and actionable.
- Human-Centered Focus:

Design thinking is built on understanding and addressing human needs, emotions, and behaviors. The topic of parental influence in sports allows us to consider influential relationships, motivation, and personal growth as they relate to the complexities of parent-child dynamics. The potential for empathy-driven design solutions within this topic is rich.
- Potential for Innovation:

While mosquito-borne diseases are an important global public health issue, the topic of parental influence in sports provides a more diverse and expansive opportunity for innovative design opportunities. We can design not only for physical health of children but also for their emotional well-being, social development, and lifelong habits.
- Preventative vs. Developmental Approach:

Mosquito-borne diseases are often approached from a preventative/public health model, which centers on environmental or public health interventions. Parental influence in sports, however, is a developmental topic which means that there is capacity to shape behaviors, relationships, and future outcomes for children.
- Potential for Immediate Impact:

Interventions associated with parental influence in sports could be implemented and evaluated more quickly, with fast feedback loops from parents, children, and educators. This allows for quick prototype development and testing and the application of user feedback.
- Personal and Community Engagement:

Working with the topic of parental influence in sports brings personal stories and communal/participatory engagement, which could allow us to create user connections that we can follow back to the themes of the insights and opportunities areas.
